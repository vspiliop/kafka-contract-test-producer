Kafka avro producer sharing Contract Tests' contracts with downstream consumers, while using Confluent Schema Registry. 
Check out https://github.com/vspiliop/kafka-contract-test-consumer for checking how to use the published contracts.

Key points:
- How to define an avro contract on the producer
- How to share it with downstream consumers
- How producer makes sure its published contracts are correct or its build will fail
- How the consumers import the contracts and use them for testing their business logic.


## Generate documentation

Documentation explaining the concepts demoed by this repo and https://github.com/vspiliop/kafka-contract-test-consumer 
can be found here: https://vspiliop.github.io/kafka-contract-test-producer

Generate locally maven documentation site from scratch. Documentation is using Markdown for text formatting, 
latex for complex tables and plantuml for diagrams. All tables and diagrams are generated by code!

```
mvn clean compile site:site -o -Dmaven.test.skip
```

Generate and push maven documentation site to GitHub Pages. Remember to create and use a Github temp token.
Execute from command line and provide GitHub username and temp token when asked.

```
mvnw clean compile site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm -o -Dmaven.test.skip
```

## Run local Jetty

Hosts the maven documentation site locally for development purposes.

```
mvn site:run -o
```

## Generate Latex artifacts

```
mvn latex:latex
```

## Generate Plantuml diagrams

```
mvn plantuml:generate
```
